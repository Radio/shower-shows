                &mdash; <strong>I'd rather see developers build kick-ass apps</strong> that are well-designed
                and follow separation of concerns, than see them waste time arguing about MV* nonsense.
                And for this reason, <strong>I hereby declare AngularJS to be MVW framework &mdash; Model-View-Whatever.</strong>
                Where Whatever stands for &ldquo;whatever works for you&rdquo;.
