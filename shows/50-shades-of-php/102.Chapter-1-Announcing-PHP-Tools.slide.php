        <div class="small">
            <p>These tools are a set of small tight cgi binaries written in C.
                <br/>They perform a number of functions including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Logging accesses to your pages in your own private log files</li>
                <li>Real-time viewing of log information</li>
                <li>Providing a nice interface to this log information</li>
                <li>Displaying last access information right on your pages</li>
                <li>Full daily and total access counters</li>
            </ul>

            ...

            <p>The tools also allow you to implement a guestbook or any other
                form that needs to write information and display it to users
                later in about 2 minutes.</p>
