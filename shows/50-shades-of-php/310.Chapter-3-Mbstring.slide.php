            <i>mbstring</i> provides multibyte specific string functions that help you
            deal with multibyte encodings in PHP. In addition to that,
            <i>mbstring</i> handles character encoding conversion between the possible encoding pairs.
            <i>mbstring</i> is designed to handle Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UCS-2
            and many single-byte encodings for convenience.
